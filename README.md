## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned that I need to learn more by making more similar projects because responsive designs with formatting take a lot of time.
Especially REM, EM, %, etc.
- I also learned some of the GitHub commands I was not aware of.
- Most important, I learned what should be in a read-me file, and how to make it (and this is my first readme file)

### Continued development

I wanted to practice my Frontend that I learned last year from freecodecamp and this first challenge made me realize I need to practice more and revise more responsive web design concepts. so I  am going to give some related challenges a shot.

### Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.w3school.com) - This helped me for every thing as I use W3School as a reference tool.
- [FontAwesome](https://www.fontawsome.com) - I used font awesome for icons.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) - This is an amazing website, I learned Responsive Web design.
